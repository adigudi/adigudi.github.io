            <p> As Steve Jobs was growing up he usually liked to be the class clown. Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times.
                <br>
                <br> Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher." He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jobs was adopted shortly after he was born.</li>
                <li>Jobs was a pescetarian, meaning he ate no meat except for fish.</li>
                <li>He had a pretty low GPA--just 2.65. Jobs admitted he never enjoyed school structure and preferred to learn in unconventional ways.</li>
                <li>Jobs was, biologically, half Arab. His biological father was Syrian and his mother was American.</li>
                <li>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak notes that Jobs never learned how to code.</li>
